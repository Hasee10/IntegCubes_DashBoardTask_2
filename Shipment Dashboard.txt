Shipment Dashboard
1. Power Query Transformations
Remove unnecessary columns.

Create a new column: Delivery Status Group:

"Successful" → Delivered

"In Progress" → Dispatched or In Transit

"Failed" → Returned or Pending

Create a Delivery Month column (format: YYYY-MM).

Merge:

Shipments with Products to get Weight & Category

Shipments with Customers to get City & Region

Shipments with Shippers for shipper names

2. Data Modeling
Create proper 1:M relationships:

Shipments → Products

Shipments → Customers

Shipments → Warehouses

Shipments → Shippers

Create a Calendar table and link it to Shipments[Date].

3. Calculated Columns
In Shipments:

Total Weight = Weight × Quantity

Cost per Item = ShippingCost ÷ Quantity

In Warehouses:

Capacity Utilized % = Sum of shipment weight stored / warehouse capacity

4. DAX Measures
Total Shipments

Avg Shipping Cost

Total Weight Shipped

On-time Delivery % = (Delivered Shipments ÷ Total Shipments)

Returned Rate % = (Returned Shipments ÷ Total Shipments)

Shipment Trend (YTD, MTD, QTD)

YoY shipment volume

5. Visualizations
KPI Cards: Total Shipments, Avg Shipping Cost, Total Weight, Returned %

Line Chart: Shipments by Month

Bar Chart: Shipments by Region or Category

Donut: Status Distribution

Matrix: Warehouse vs Product Category vs Weight

Slicers: Shipper, Month, Status, Category

6. Advanced UX Features
Tooltip Page:

On hover over shipment → show status, quantity, cost, customer

Drillthrough Page:

On customer → show all their shipments and delivery trends

Bookmarks:

View by Category / View by Region

-- basic data transformation techniques
✅ 1. Rename Columns (Optional but Helpful)
Make names user-friendly. E.g., ProductID → Product ID, CustomerName → Customer Name.

✅ 2. Remove Unnecessary Columns
If you won’t be using fields like ContactNumber or Weight, remove them to improve performance.

✅ 3. Set Data Types
Make sure each column has the appropriate data type:

Dates → Date

IDs → Whole Number or Text (depending on format)

Quantity, ShippingCost → Decimal Number

Names/Locations → Text

Status → Text or Categorical

✅ 4. Remove Duplicates in Lookup Tables
Ensure Customers, Products, Shippers, and Warehouses don’t have duplicate rows by key (e.g., CustomerID).

✅ 5. Trim and Clean Text Columns
Use Transform → Format → Trim and Clean on all text columns (like CustomerName, ProductName, etc.) to remove hidden characters and spaces.

✅ 6. Create Relationships (Post Power Query in Model View)
Once queries are loaded:

Link Shipments[CustomerID] → Customers[CustomerID]

Link Shipments[ProductID] → Products[ProductID]

Link Shipments[ShipperID] → Shippers[ShipperID]

Link Shipments[WarehouseID] → Warehouses[WarehouseID]

✅ 7. Add Index Columns if Needed
For tracking or sorting (e.g., in Shipments), add an Index column via Power Query.

✅ 8. Filter Out Blank or Invalid Data
In each table, especially Shipments, filter out rows where key fields like CustomerID, ProductID, or ShipmentID are null.

✅ 9. Merge Queries (Optional)
For easier analysis, you might:

Merge Shipments with Products to get ProductName inline.

Merge Shipments with Customers to get CustomerName and Region.

Keep both separate and merged queries depending on reporting needs.
